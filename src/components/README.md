- Shared, reusable UI components across the entire app

- The `components/` directory includes global UI building blocks and structural UI used throughout the application.

- ðŸ§© What Is the components/ Folder?
- It contains:

  - Atomic UI (buttons, inputs, modals)
  - Shared layout elements (navbar, sidebar)
  - Visual components with no domain-specific logic

- âœ… Why Use It?
  - Promotes reuse and design consistency
  - Reduces duplication of common UI patterns
  - Makes testing and maintenance easier
  - Keeps UI logic separate from business logic
